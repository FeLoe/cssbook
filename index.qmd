This website contains the full contents (text, code examples, and figures) of the book and is (and will be) available completely free and open access. We hope that this will make computational techniques accessible (and fun!) to as many students and researchers as possible, regardless of means and institutional support. We also hope that this will make it easy for students and professors to use a sub set of chapters without forcing students to buy the whole book. We would really like to thank Wiley-Blackwell for their confidence in making this open access option possible.

## Status of this book

This is the book as published in 2022 by Wiley-Blackwell. Note that most of the content is written in 2021, and in some areas the technology moves very quickly. 
For that reason, we are working on an updated version.
This version is hosted at [v2.cssbook.net](https://v2.cssbook.net) and should be considered a draft / work in progress.
Please visit that site and/or the [github page](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/cssbook) to learn more.

In the chapters where we (are planning to) do a more major rewrite, a note will also be placed in this version of the book so you can see where we think the content
would benefit from an update.  

### What can you do to help:

 - Create a [github issue](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/cssbook/issues) if you see any errors, find anything hard to understand, or have any other sort of suggestions or feedback.
 - Fix typo's or other issues directly by editing the relevant file on [github](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/cssbook/) and creating a pull request

Any contributors will be acknowledged on this page and in a possible second edition of the book.
If you are willing to contribute in a more major way (e.g. rewrite or add an entire chapter), please [get in touch](mailto:wouter.van.atteveldt@vu.nl) with us and we can work something out. 

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank colleagues, friends, and students who provided feedback and input on earlier versions of parts of the manuscript: Dmitry Bogdanov, Andreu Casas, Modesto Escobar, Anne Kroon, Nicolas Mattis , Cecil Meeusen, Jesús Sánchez-Oro, Nel Ruigrok, Susan Vermeer, Mehdi Zamani, Marthe Möller. Of course, we also want to thank all others that we might have forgotten to mention here (sorry!) -- please contact us if you feel that your name should be here.
